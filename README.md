# GBrain

Open source personal knowledge brain. Postgres + pgvector + hybrid search that actually works.

```bash
gbrain query "what does Paul Graham say about doing things that don't scale?"
```

```
concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale (concept) score=0.0312
  The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to
  recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to...

concepts/how-to-get-startup-ideas (concept) score=0.0298
  The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.
  It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself...

concepts/relentlessly-resourceful (concept) score=0.0251
  Not merely relentless. That's not enough to make things go your way
  except in a few mostly uninteresting domains. In any interesting domain...
```

Hybrid search finds essays by meaning, not just keywords. "Doing things that don't scale" matches even when the exact phrase doesn't appear. That's the point.

## Why this exists

You have a brain full of knowledge. It lives in markdown files, meeting notes, CRM exports, Obsidian vaults, Notion databases. It's scattered, unsearchable, and going stale.

Search is the bottleneck. Keyword search misses semantic matches. Vector search misses exact names and phrases. Neither connects related ideas across documents.

GBrain fixes this with hybrid search that combines both approaches, plus a knowledge model that treats every page like an intelligence assessment: compiled truth on top (your current best understanding, rewritten when evidence changes), append-only timeline on the bottom (the evidence trail that never gets edited).

AI agents maintain the brain. You ingest a document and the agent updates every entity mentioned, creates cross-reference links, and appends timeline entries. MCP clients query it. The intelligence lives in fat markdown skills, not application code.

## Try it: Paul Graham's essays in 90 seconds

GBrain ships with 10 Paul Graham essays as a kindling corpus. After setup, they're already in your brain:

```bash
# What's in there?
gbrain stats
# Pages: 10, Chunks: 47, Embedded: 47, Links: 0

# Keyword search (fast, exact matches)
gbrain search "startups"

# Hybrid search (the good one, semantic + keyword + expansion)
gbrain query "what makes a great founder?"

# Read a specific essay
gbrain get concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale

# Find essays related to a concept
gbrain query "when should you ignore conventional wisdom?"

# Check brain health
gbrain health
# Pages: 10, Embed coverage: 100%, Stale: 0, Orphans: 10
```

The essays are just the demo. The real power is when you import your own knowledge, thousands of pages about people, companies, projects, and the connections between them.

## Install

### Prerequisites

GBrain needs three things to run:

| Dependency | What it's for | How to get it |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Supabase account** | Postgres + pgvector database | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (Pro tier, $25/mo for 8GB) |
| **OpenAI API key** | Embeddings (text-embedding-3-large) | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| **Anthropic API key** | Multi-query expansion + LLM chunking (Haiku) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

Set the API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

The Supabase connection URL is configured during `gbrain init`. The OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs read their keys from the environment automatically.

Without an OpenAI key, search still works (keyword only, no vector search). Without an Anthropic key, search still works (no multi-query expansion, no LLM chunking).

### With OpenClaw (recommended)

If you're running OpenClaw, tell it to set up your brain. Make sure your API keys are set in the environment first.

```
You: "Install gbrain and set up my knowledge brain.
      I need you to:
      1. Run: bun add gbrain
      2. Run: gbrain init --supabase (follow the wizard to connect my Supabase database)
      3. Run: gbrain import data/kindling/ (import the demo corpus)
      4. Read the skill files in skills/ so you know how to use the brain"
```

OpenClaw will install the package, walk through the Supabase connection wizard, import demo data, and learn the 6 brain skills (ingest, query, maintain, enrich, briefing, migrate).

After setup, you talk to your brain through OpenClaw:

```
You: "What essays do we have about startups?"
You: "Ingest my meeting notes from today"
You: "Give me a briefing for my meetings tomorrow"
You: "Import my Obsidian vault into the brain"
```

OpenClaw reads the skill files in `skills/`, figures out which gbrain commands to run, and does the work. You never touch the CLI directly unless you want to.

### With ClawHub

```bash
clawhub install gbrain
```

This installs the npm package, copies the skill files, and runs `gbrain init --supabase` on first use.

### Standalone CLI

```bash
npm install -g gbrain
```

### As a library

```bash
bun add gbrain
```

```typescript
import { PostgresEngine } from 'gbrain';
```

All paths require a Postgres database with pgvector. Supabase Pro ($25/mo) is the recommended zero-ops option.

## Setup

After installing via CLI or library path, run the setup wizard:

```bash
# Guided wizard: auto-provisions Supabase or accepts a connection URL
gbrain init --supabase

# Or connect to any Postgres with pgvector
gbrain init --url postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

The init wizard:
1. Checks for Supabase CLI, offers auto-provisioning
2. Falls back to manual connection URL if CLI isn't available
3. Runs the full schema migration (tables, indexes, triggers, extensions)
4. Imports the kindling corpus (10 PG essays) as demo data
5. Verifies the connection and prints your first query to try

Config is saved to `~/.gbrain/config.json` with 0600 permissions.

OpenClaw users skip this step. The orchestrator runs the wizard for you during install.

## First import

```bash
# Import your markdown wiki (auto-chunks and auto-embeds)
gbrain import /path/to/brain/

# Skip embedding if you want to import fast and embed later
gbrain import /path/to/brain/ --no-embed

# Backfill embeddings for pages that don't have them
gbrain embed --stale
```

Import is idempotent. Re-running it skips unchanged files (compared by SHA-256 content hash). Progress bar shows status. ~30s for text import of 7,000 files, ~10-15 min for embedding.

## The knowledge model

Every page in the brain follows the compiled truth + timeline pattern:

```markdown
---
type: concept
title: Do Things That Don't Scale
tags: [startups, growth, pg-essay]
---

Paul Graham's argument that startups should do unscalable things early on.
The most common: recruiting users manually, one at a time. Airbnb went
door to door in New York photographing apartments. Stripe manually
installed their payment integration for early users.

The key insight: the unscalable effort teaches you what users actually
want, which you can't learn any other way.

- 2025-02-20: Cited in discussion about AI agent onboarding strategies
```

Above the `---` separator: **compiled truth**. Your current best understanding. Gets rewritten when new evidence changes the picture. Below: **timeline**. Append-only evidence trail. Never edited, only added to.

The compiled truth is the answer. The timeline is the proof.

## How search works

```
Query: "when should you ignore conventional wisdom?"
         |
    Multi-query expansion (Claude Haiku)
    "contrarian thinking startups", "going against the crowd"
         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
  Vector    Keyword
  (HNSW     (tsvector +
  cosine)    ts_rank)
    |         |
    +----+----+
         |
    RRF Fusion: score = sum(1/(60 + rank))
         |
    4-Layer Dedup
    1. Best chunk per page
    2. Cosine similarity > 0.85
    3. Type diversity (60% cap)
    4. Per-page chunk cap
         |
    Stale alerts (compiled truth older than latest timeline)
         |
    Results
```

Keyword search alone misses conceptual matches. "Ignore conventional wisdom" won't find an essay titled "The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius" even though it's exactly about that. Vector search alone misses exact phrases when the embedding is diluted by surrounding text. RRF fusion gets both right. Multi-query expansion catches phrasings you didn't think of.

## Database schema

9 tables in Postgres + pgvector:

```
pages                    The core content table
  slug (UNIQUE)          e.g. "concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale"
  type                   person, company, deal, yc, civic, project, concept, source, media
  title, compiled_truth, timeline
  frontmatter (JSONB)    Arbitrary metadata
  search_vector          Trigger-based tsvector (title + compiled_truth + timeline + timeline_entries)
  content_hash           SHA-256 for import idempotency

content_chunks           Chunked content with embeddings
  page_id (FK)           Links to pages
  chunk_text             The chunk content
  chunk_source           'compiled_truth' or 'timeline'
  embedding (vector)     1536-dim from text-embedding-3-large
  HNSW index             Cosine similarity search

links                    Cross-references between pages
  from_page_id, to_page_id
  link_type              knows, invested_in, works_at, founded, references, etc.

tags                     page_id + tag (many-to-many)

timeline_entries         Structured timeline events
  page_id, date, source, summary, detail (markdown)

page_versions            Snapshot history for compiled_truth
  compiled_truth, frontmatter, snapshot_at

raw_data                 Sidecar JSON from external APIs
  page_id, source, data (JSONB)

ingest_log               Audit trail of import/ingest operations

config                   Brain-level settings (embedding model, chunk strategy)
```

Indexes: B-tree on slug/type, GIN on frontmatter/search_vector, HNSW on embeddings, pg_trgm on title for fuzzy slug resolution.

## Chunking

Three strategies, dispatched by content type:

**Recursive** (timeline, bulk import): 5-level delimiter hierarchy (paragraphs, lines, sentences, clauses, words). 300-word chunks with 50-word sentence-aware overlap. Fast, predictable, lossless.

**Semantic** (compiled truth): Embeds each sentence, computes adjacent cosine similarities, applies Savitzky-Golay smoothing to find topic boundaries. Falls back to recursive on failure. Best quality for intelligence assessments.

**LLM-guided** (high-value content, on request): Pre-splits into 128-word candidates, asks Claude Haiku to identify topic shifts in sliding windows. 3 retries per window. Most expensive, best results.

## Using as a library

GBrain is library-first. The CLI and MCP server are thin wrappers over the engine.

```typescript
import { PostgresEngine } from 'gbrain';

const engine = new PostgresEngine();
await engine.connect({ database_url: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
await engine.initSchema();

// Write a page
await engine.putPage('concepts/superlinear-returns', {
  type: 'concept',
  title: 'Superlinear Returns',
  compiled_truth: 'Paul Graham argues that returns in many fields are superlinear...',
  timeline: '- 2023-10-01: Published on paulgraham.com',
});

// Hybrid search
const results = await engine.searchKeyword('startup growth');

// Typed links
await engine.addLink('concepts/superlinear-returns', 'concepts/do-things-that-dont-scale', '', 'references');

// Graph traversal
const graph = await engine.traverseGraph('concepts/superlinear-returns', 3);

// Health check
const health = await engine.getHealth();
// { page_count: 10, embed_coverage: 1.0, stale_pages: 0, orphan_pages: 10 }
```

The `BrainEngine` interface is pluggable. See `docs/ENGINES.md` for how to add backends.

## MCP server

Add to your Claude Code or Cursor MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbrain": {
      "command": "gbrain",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

20 tools: get_page, put_page, delete_page, list_pages, search, query, add_tag, remove_tag, get_tags, add_link, remove_link, get_links, get_backlinks, traverse_graph, add_timeline_entry, get_timeline, get_stats, get_health, get_versions, revert_version.

Every tool mirrors a CLI command. Drift tests verify identical behavior.

## Skills

Fat markdown files that tell AI agents HOW to use gbrain. No skill logic in the binary.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **ingest** | Ingest meetings, docs, articles. Updates compiled truth (rewrite, not append), appends timeline, creates cross-reference links across all mentioned entities. |
| **query** | 3-layer search (keyword + vector + structured) with synthesis and citations. Says "the brain doesn't have info on X" rather than hallucinating. |
| **maintain** | Periodic health: find contradictions, stale compiled truth, orphan pages, dead links, tag inconsistency, missing embeddings, overdue threads. |
| **enrich** | Enrich pages from external APIs. Raw data stored separately, distilled highlights go to compiled truth. |
| **briefing** | Daily briefing: today's meetings with participant context, active deals with deadlines, time-sensitive threads, recent changes. |
| **migrate** | Universal migration from Obsidian (wikilinks to gbrain links), Notion (stripped UUIDs), Logseq (block refs), plain markdown, CSV, JSON, Roam. |

## Architecture

```
CLI / MCP Server
     (thin wrappers, identical operations)
              |
      BrainEngine interface
       (pluggable backend)
              |
     +--------+--------+
     |                  |
PostgresEngine     SQLiteEngine
  (ships v0)       (designed, community PRs welcome)
     |
Supabase Pro ($25/mo)
  Postgres + pgvector + pg_trgm
  connection pooling via Supavisor
```

Embedding, chunking, and search fusion are engine-agnostic. Only raw keyword search (`searchKeyword`) and raw vector search (`searchVector`) are engine-specific. RRF fusion, multi-query expansion, and 4-layer dedup run above the engine on `SearchResult[]` arrays.

## Storage estimates

For a brain with ~7,500 pages:

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Page text (compiled_truth + timeline) | ~150MB |
| JSONB frontmatter + indexes | ~70MB |
| Content chunks (~22K, text) | ~80MB |
| Embeddings (22K x 1536 floats) | ~134MB |
| HNSW index overhead | ~270MB |
| Links, tags, timeline, versions | ~50MB |
| **Total** | **~750MB** |

Supabase free tier (500MB) won't fit a large brain. Supabase Pro ($25/mo, 8GB) is the starting point.

Initial embedding cost: ~$4-5 for 7,500 pages via OpenAI text-embedding-3-large.
